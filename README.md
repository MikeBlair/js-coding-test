# CodingTest

A quick way to get a look at someone's approach to coding.
Test Driven Development. I give you the tests, and you make them pass.

## Instructions

1.  Clone this repository onto your local computer
1.  `git checkout -b coding-test`
1.  Implement the code to get the specs passing
1.  Commit your changes to the `coding-test` branch
1.  Use `git format-patch master --stdout > coding-test.patch` to store your commits
1.  Email the patch file(s) to the person who pointed you to this project (or me: robertlubecker@gmail.com)
